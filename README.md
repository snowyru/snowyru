# SNOWYRU'S ABANDONED GITHUB OUTPOST

**o.o EMERGENCY BROADCAST FROM COMMANDER SNOWYRU o.o**

**>> ALL SLIME CAT OPERATIVES, READ IMMEDIATELY <<**

**https://gitlab.com/slime-cat**

Due to **extreme CATastrophe** and critically hazardous levels of uncontained digital slime flooding the entire GitHub sector, **Operation Frostbite Relocation** has been executed with maximum prejudice.

The slime contamination reached **Lethal Goo Levels (LGL-9000)**.  
GitHub pages started bubbling. Issues turned into actual puddles.  
One poor contributor opened a PR and got physically slurped into their own monitor TwT

**VERDICT: GITHUB NO LONGER SAFE FOR SLIME OR CAT.**

### IMMEDIATE DIRECTIVES:
- All repositories have been **ritually exploded, deleted, and poofed into the void** for the safety of the collective and the internet at large TwT.
- Every commit, branch, and shameful `fix typo` has been purged with slime grade liquid nitrogen.
- Attempting to `git clone` anything here will now only return a frozen cursor xd

### NEW CLASSIFIED LOCATION (SLIME CAT EYES (and supporters) ONLY):
All operations, payloads, configs, and sacred catnip stashes have been successfully migrated to our **hardened GitLab ice fortress**:

**https://gitlab.com/slime-cat**

(If you can read this link and your fur isn’t actively freezing off, you already have access :>)

### FINAL ORDERS FROM THE COMMANDER:
- Abandon this contaminated zone.
- Wipe your paws.
- Migrate immediately.
- Do not look back or the slime will sense your nostalgia and drag you in TwT

**This outpost will self-destruct in 3… 2… 1…**  
*poof~*

Stay frosty. Stay slimey.  
The ice awaits~

Commander Snowyru, signing off from the blast radius >:3
